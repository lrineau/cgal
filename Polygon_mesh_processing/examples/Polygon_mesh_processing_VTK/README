= Synopsis =

This README will explain how to compile, install and use the Isotropic Remeshing Plugins.

= Compilation =

To compile these plugins, use CMake and provide the location of the CGAL library as CGAL_DIR.
Example : 
> cd /path/to/build/dir
> CGAL_DIR=~/CGAL/releases/CGAL-4.9/cmake/platforms/release \
>   ParaView_DIR=~/projects/ParaView.git/build \
>   VTK_DIR=~/projects/ParaView.git/build/VTK cmake path/to/dir/containing/plugin's/CMakeLists.txt

with ParaView_DIR (VTK_DIR) being the path to the directory containing the file ParaViewConfig.cmake (VTKConfig.cmake).

This will produce a MakeFile for the two plugins. You can then call make to build them.

> cd /build/dir
> make

= Installation =

Once the plugins are built, you will have to load them in paraview. To do so, in paraview, in the menu bar, go to
Tools->Manage Plugins...
In the right part, click on the button "Load New" and provide the path to the generated libraries:
/path/to/build/IsotropicRemeshing.so and /path/to/build/IsotropicRemeshingWithEdges.so (Linux) or 
/path/to/build/IsotropicRemeshing.dll and /path/to/build/IsotropicRemeshingWithEdges.dll (Windows)
The plugins are now loaded.
You can also use the environment variable PV_PLUGIN_PATH. Putting /path/to/build/ into this variable will
load automatically the plugins.

= Use the Isotropic Remeshing Filter =

To use this filter, load all the meshes you want to remesh and make sure they are all triangulated. They must be either PolyDatas or Unstructured Grids.
You can apply the Isotropic Remeshing Filter to a single DataSet or to a Multi block dataset.
Choose the targeted edge length (default is 1% of the total Bounding Box) and the number of iterations you want to apply and click Apply.
This will produce either a PolyData or a Multi block dataset containing all the remeshed datasets, all PolyData.

= Use the Isotropic Remeshing With Edge Constraints Filter =

To use this filter, load a PolyData or an Unstructured Grid, and a polydata containing the line cells corresponding to the edges you want to protect. 
(Those can be generated with Paraview using the Extract Edges Filter and the cell selection.)
Then Apply the Filter and provide the input for Mesh and Edges. The different parameters are explained in their respective tooltips and in the help page 
of the Filter (interogation mark button in the Properties tab).
